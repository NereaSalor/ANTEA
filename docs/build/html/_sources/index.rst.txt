ANTEA: ANalysis Tool Environment for petAlo
===========================================
ANTEA contains functions for processing NEXUS-generated Monte Carlo events and
for full PET image reconstruction.

Overview
--------
The basic procedure for generating simulated events and reconstructing a PET
image can be performed in three different ways:

1. :ref:`Full simulation: NEXUS --> Coincidence selection/reconstruction -> Image Reco <fullmc>`
2. :ref:`Fast simulation: NEXUS --> Fast MC --> Image Reco <fastmc>`
3. :ref:`Fast-fast simulation: Fast-fast MC --> Image Reco <fastfastmc>`

Examples
--------
* `Image reconstruction with fast-fast MC <https://github.com/nextic/ANTEA/docs/examples/petalo_reconstruction_fastfastmc_example.ipynb>`_
